Remote Image Viewer Web Application: Requirements Specification
1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Remote Image Viewer, a web application that runs as a Docker container on a Linux server. It allows users to securely connect to a remote image storage server from a web browser on Windows 11 to browse and view image files as a thumbnail gallery without installing any client-side software.

2. Purpose and Scope
2.1. Purpose
To streamline the process of reviewing images stored on a remote server (e.g., web assets, machine learning datasets, photographic data).

To eliminate the need to manually download files using scp or sftp for viewing.

To provide a secure and user-friendly way for non-engineers to visually inspect images on a remote server.

2.2. In Scope
Browsing a remote server's directory structure via a web browser.

Displaying a thumbnail gallery of image files in a selected directory.

Previewing full-size images by clicking on thumbnails.

Downloading selected images to the local PC.

2.3. Out of Scope
Image editing or manipulation features.

Advanced file management operations (upload, delete, rename, move).

Support for protocols other than SSH/SFTP (e.g., FTP, SMB).

3. Functional Requirements

Feature Name

Description

FR-1

Connection

Server Connection

The backend server will manage SSH connections. Users will select a pre-configured target server from the Web UI.

FR-2

File Browsing

Directory Tree View

After connecting, the application will display the server's file system in a tree-like structure.

FR-3

File Browsing

Thumbnail Gallery

The application will display a thumbnail gallery for all supported image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, RAW) in the selected directory.

FR-4

File Browsing

Image Preview

Clicking a thumbnail will open the full-size image in a modal window (lightbox).

FR-5

File Operation

Image Download

Users can select one or more images to download to their local PC through the browser's download functionality.

FR-6

UI/UX

Metadata Display

Hovering over a thumbnail will display basic file information, such as filename, size, and last modified date.

FR-7

File Browsing

RAW Image Processing

The application will support rendering monochrome raw image data.
- If the file size is 327,680 bytes, it will be interpreted as a 640x512 grayscale image.
- Otherwise, if the file size is a perfect square (N*N), it will be interpreted as a square grayscale image (sqrt(size) x sqrt(size)).
- Files that do not meet these criteria will be skipped, and an error will be logged.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

Category

Requirement

NFR-1

Performance

The UI must remain responsive even when browsing directories with a large number of images (e.g., >1000).
Thumbnails will be lazy-loaded to improve initial page load times and reduce network traffic.

NFR-2

Security

All communication between the user's browser and the web application server must be encrypted using HTTPS.
SSH credentials for connecting to the image storage server must be securely stored and managed on the backend server.

NFR-3

Usability

The web interface must be simple and intuitive for non-technical users.

NFR-4

Platform

Client: Modern web browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) on Windows 11.
Image Storage Server: Major Linux distributions.

NFR-5

Deployment

The backend application must be packaged as a Docker container, allowing it to run on any Linux host with Docker installed. This ensures portability and simplifies environment setup.

5. System Architecture Proposal
A 3-tier architecture is proposed, consisting of a client (browser), an application server (Docker), and an image storage server (agent).

5.1. Frontend (Web Browser)
Role: Renders the user interface and handles user interactions.

Environment: Modern web browser on Windows 11.

Implementation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frameworks like React or Vue.js are recommended).

5.2. Backend (Web Application Server)
Role: Acts as the application's core, relaying requests from the frontend to the image storage server.

Deployment: Runs as a Docker container on a Linux application server.

Key Functions:

Serves the frontend UI (HTML/CSS/JS).

Securely manages SSH credentials and connections to the image storage server.

Executes the server-side agent via SSH in response to frontend requests and returns the results.

Tech Stack Candidates: Node.js (Express), Python (Django, Flask), Go.

5.3. Server-side Agent (CLI Script)
Role: Performs the actual file operations and image processing on the target server.

Location: Deployed on each target image storage server.

Key Functions:

Generates file lists (e.g., in JSON format) for a given directory.

Dynamically creates thumbnails (including for RAW images) using libraries like ImageMagick or Pillow.

Returns data (file lists, image streams) to the backend via standard output or temporary files.
